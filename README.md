# rq_copy
Automates the copying of values from a csv file into RQ

2 Versions
1. Pastes values only
2. Pastes values and the quantity of that value

Uses Python 2.7
Requires pyperclip and pyautogui

I wrote this because I wanted to automate the copying of values from spreadsheets into RQ when creating purchase orders, but it should work in RQ whenever you need to paste in a bunch of values.
